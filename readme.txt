- to the next dev who needs to deal with this site -

This has been built on Hugo, but 
doesn't really use any of the hugo features.

This has basically been written in pure html.

You can find all you can see in layouts>partials>nav.html

Footer.html is the only editable through config.yaml

index compiles script.html, nav.html, head.html and the footer.

_default is completely obsolete. 

Some styles are in static>css>style.css

no themes have been used in this project.

All images are in static>css>img

I am definitely not proud of this.
-Good luck.
